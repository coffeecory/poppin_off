To read a file from a remote computer using Cyware SOAR, you can use the Cyware SOAR SDK for Python. Here are the steps to read a file from a remote computer using Cyware SOAR:

1. Install the Cyware SOAR SDK for Python using pip command. Open the command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   pip install cyapi
   ```

2. Import the `cyapi` module:

   ```
   import cyapi
   ```

3. Instantiate the `CyAPI` client by passing your Cyware SOAR API key:

   ```
   client = cyapi.CyAPI(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
   ```

4. Use the `run_action()` method of the `CyAPI` client to run the `FileDownload` action on the remote computer. Here is an example of how to run the `FileDownload` action:

   ```
   action_name = 'FileDownload'
   asset_name = 'remote_computer'
   asset_type = 'Windows'
   parameters = {'FilePath': 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt'}
   action_result = client.run_action(action_name, asset_name, asset_type, parameters)
   ```

   Replace 'remote_computer' with the name of the remote computer asset in Cyware SOAR. Replace 'Windows' with the type of the asset. Replace 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' with the actual path of the file you want to download.

5. Access the downloaded file data and read its contents from the `Action Results` object returned by the `run_action()` method:

   ```
   data = action_result.json()['ResultData']
   file_contents = data['ActionOutput'][0]['Data']
   ```

   This will retrieve and store the contents of the downloaded file in the `file_contents` variable.

By following these steps, you should now be able to read a file from a remote computer using Cyware SOAR in Python. Note that you will need to replace the example values used above with the actual values for your Cyware SOAR API key, remote computer asset name, and file path.
